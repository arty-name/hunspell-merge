# hunspell-merge

**Abandoned** software for merging several hunspell dictionaries.

This was created by other people and I have used it years ago. 
When the Google Code was closed, I preserved the [original repository](https://code.google.com/p/hunspell-merge/) by migrating it to GitHub.

I am incapable of maintaining this code, so youâ€™d have to address any issues by yourself or to find a Java developer for that.
